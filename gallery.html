        <p>
            Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement.
            <br />
            It's characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes.
            <br />
            Also open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities
            <br />
            (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter etc...
            <br />
            Impressionist art is a style in which the artist captures the image of an object as
            <br />
            someone would see it if they just caught a glimpse of it.
            <br />
            They paint the pictures with a lot of color and most of their pictures are outdoor scenes.
            <br />
            The Impressionists created a model for freedom and subjectivity that promoted
            <br />
            artistic freedom that which many artists of the past longed for.
            <br />
            Their example empowered later artists that took it much further than they did.

            <br />
            that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and

            <br />
            It has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.
            <br />
            Cubism was created principally by the painters Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris between 1907 and
            1914.
            <br />
            The Cubist style is characterized by fragmented subject matter deconstructed in such a way
            <br />
            that it can be viewed from multiple angles simultaneously.

            Surrealism was a cultural movement which developed in Europe in the
            <br />
            aftermath of World War I and was largely influenced by Dada.
            <br />
            The movement is best known for its visual artworks and writings and the juxtaposition of uncommon imagery.
            <br />
            Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected
            associations,
            <br />
            in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought.
            <br />
            Andre Breton defined Surrealism as "psychic automatism in its pure state,
            <br />
            by which one proposes to express - verbally,
            <br />
            by means of the written word, or in any other manner - the actual functioning of thought."
